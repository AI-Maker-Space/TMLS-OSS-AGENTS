# Creating a Project API Key in OpenAI

To use OpenAI's API throughout this bootcamp - please ensure you follow their new API Key process:

1. Create a new project, and name it "aim" or "aie3" (technically the name doesn't matter - but for ease of tracking it's likely good to use something to indicates this is a project for this course).
